Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a highly persistent degradation product of other PFAS, including some pesticides, and can remain in surface and groundwater for long periods. PFOS is a priority substance under the EU Water Framework Directive, with environmental quality standards of 0.65 ng/l for inland surface waters, 0.13 ng/l for coastal and transitional waters, and 9.1 µg/kg (wet weight) for biota.\nNo data for Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Slovakia.",
